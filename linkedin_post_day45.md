# Day 45 of 90 Days ML Challenge - Web Scraping for Financial Data 📊

🚀 **Web Scraping Mastery: Extracting Stock Data with Python**

Today I dove deep into the world of web scraping for financial data analysis! Here's what I accomplished:

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**
✅ **BeautifulSoup & Requests**: Built a robust web scraping pipeline to extract historical stock data from HTML tables
✅ **Data Parsing**: Mastered HTML parsing techniques to navigate complex table structures using `find()` and `find_all()` methods
✅ **DataFrame Construction**: Converted raw HTML data into structured pandas DataFrames for analysis
✅ **Dual Approach**: Implemented both BeautifulSoup manual extraction and pandas `read_html()` for comparison

## 📈 **Key Features Developed:**
🎯 **Netflix Stock Data Extraction**: Successfully scraped historical prices (Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
🎯 **Amazon Stock Data Analysis**: Completed comprehensive exercises with real-world financial data
🎯 **Error Handling**: Implemented proper warning management and data validation
🎯 **Clean Code Structure**: Organized code with clear documentation and best practices

## 🛠️ **Libraries & Tools Used:**
- `requests` for HTTP requests
- `BeautifulSoup4` for HTML parsing
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `html5lib` & `lxml` for robust parsing
- `plotly` for potential visualization

## 💡 **Key Learnings:**
- Understanding HTML table structures (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<tbody>`)
- Efficient data extraction from web pages
- Converting unstructured web data to structured formats
- Handling different parsing approaches for various use cases

## 🧹 **Project Cleanup:**
- Removed all watermarks and branding elements
- Filled in all exercise blocks with functional code
- Created a professional, production-ready notebook

This project reinforced how web scraping is essential for financial data analysis when APIs aren't available. The combination of BeautifulSoup's flexibility and pandas' efficiency makes it powerful for real-world data extraction tasks.

Next up: Advanced data visualization and analysis of the extracted financial data! 📊
